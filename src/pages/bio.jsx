          julie dusuel is a French artist currently living between Marseille and London, but originally from Amiens in the North of France.

          They spent a large part of their adulthood in Marseille, studying for a BA in Fine Art at the ESADMM followed by an MFA.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have now graduated from the Royal College of Art in London as part of the Contemporary Art Practice pathway.
        </p>
        <p>
          They care most for questions and research around and inside erotism and desire, social justice and ecology, from an intersectional and queer feminist perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          They use writing, moving-image, extended reality, sculpture, and sonic material as my main languages.
          Through their work they imagine ways to step away from the dominant gaze and the anthropocentric experience, breaking through different layers of reality.
          Their own healing is part of the process.
