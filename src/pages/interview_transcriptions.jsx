        Notes from Léa:
        <br/>
        I’ve asked Julie to bring a memory with her which she can describe to me (a happy one or a neutral one) as well as a memory from her mental health crisis. The second one is difficult for her to pinpoint.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Julie:
        <br/>
        I can still visualise it a bit, it’s going away. I don’t think it’s that precise anymore.<br/>
        Just happy in a way that feels really free.<br/>
        There is no story, there is no past and no future - it's a suspended time, so it makes stuff really possible.<br/>
        When I’m not feeling good, I’m mainly in remote, thinking about other stuff. I rarely picture open wide spaces.<br/>
        I’m really good at loopholes, doing loopholes about past relationships. It’s a great space of pain, so I don't need to look too far - it's just there.<br/>
        During long phases of time where I was not feeling good it’s really hard to pick like, even a day.<br/>
        Not feeling good is also the incapacity to be in the present, you’re somewhere else, but you’re not in the present - you’re so far.<br/>
        It’s just this blurry period of time. I imagine a lot of the time when this happens I’m a lot on a sofa or a bed.<br/>
        It was a full year where I don’t know what I’ve done for a full year. I have no idea. It’s really hard to remember.<br/>
        The only thing I have from this time is little pieces of writing. But who wants to read that. You always describe the same sensation. For me it's very physical, feeling something in your stomach.<br/>
        There’s this feeling of emptiness which is related to something else. It feels really physical. There is a huge hole in the middle.<br/>
        I know it was bad but I don’t really remember it.<br/>
        Even if you know so many people feel similar, it's so hard to share with anyone. It’s not really intelligible because it is a sensation based on thoughts, not rational thoughts.<br/>
        It’s like what people say, when you give birth you have to forget the pain. It’s probably the same process - you kind of have to forget the whole process otherwise you wouldn’t be able to move forward.<br/>
        You also feel very privileged to recognise there’s a problem.<br/>
        Absolute desire for something where it’s pushed to destruction.<br/>
        Sensation of something stronger, something so uncontrollable and abstract that it feels like it’s taking over.<br/>
        Often the main thing is feeling extremely tired, starting having loopy thoughts. Feeling like I just want to stay home for a few days. Just feeling like a very heavy sad feeling. Everything is a bit difficult.<br/>
        Much easier to recognise it now, making it easier in general. It just kind of vanishes. I don’t think about it.<br/>
        I’m always surprised when it comes back and always terrified.<br/>
        Interacting with people is difficult and doing your job if you have a job is difficult. You have no idea how long it’s going to last for, if it’s going to be a day, a week or if it will need more than that how long it will last for. Whenever it’s not there you feel like, “Oh, I moved on”. I recognise it more, and when you're in it’s like nothing has changed, I haven’t solved anything. And every time there’s a wake up time, like I haven’t done the work I should have done. It’s really hard to accept that’s what’s going to be. (…) and you hope you’re in an environment and surrounded by people who can accept that this happened sometimes and there’s not much to do about it.<br/>
        Anything that can just switch it off. for me it was a lot of crying and doing the minimum possible.<br/>
        In London a lot of people - most people, as I experienced it - were alienated by my emotions.<br/>
        It’s the snake situation where you try to express something which takes you a lot of energy and courage and you feel rejected but rejection is a trigger to depression so you just go back deeper. You have to express, otherwise, you’re acting out constantly. If I think about this phase, it felt really lonely. It felt really lonely.<br/>
